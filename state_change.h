/*! \class StateChange

    A generic helper to robustly set and verify state changes using ResourceItems.

    The main purpose of this helper is to ensure that a state will be set: For example
    a group cast to turn on 20 lights might not turn on all lights, in this case the
    StateChange detects that a light has not been turned on and can retry the respective command.

    A StateChange may have an arbitrary long "change-timeout" to support changing configurations
    for sleeping or not yet powered devices.

    StateChange is bound to a Resource and can be added by Resource::addStateChange(). Multiple
    StateChange items may be added if needed, for example to set on, brightness and color or to verify that a
    scene is called correctly, even if the scene cluster doesn't have the correct values stored in
    the device NVRAM.
