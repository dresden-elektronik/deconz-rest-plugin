### Radio Silence

All mains powered IKEA lights and repeaters have a bug that causes the device to not operate correctly anymore. The bug is triggered mostly in larger networks with many end-devices likely after receiving a Parent Announce message a few times.

**Workaround:** To get the device back online it must be power-cycled. Which means cut the power for a few seconds. After that the device should work normally again.
