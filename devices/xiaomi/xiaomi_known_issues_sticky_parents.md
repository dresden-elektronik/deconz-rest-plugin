### Sticky Parents

Almost all Xiaomi end-devices stick to their parent after pairing.
The parent is the device which repeats the signal, it can be a router or the coordinator.

Once a parent is cut from power or otherwise lost, the end-device won't automatically search for a new parent and appears to be offline.

&rarr; Best practice for pairing is therefore to pair the device at the place where it's gonna be installed to force it to select a *good* parent. It's also advisable to power off all routers which aren't powered all the time, so that they aren't considered as parent when pairing.
