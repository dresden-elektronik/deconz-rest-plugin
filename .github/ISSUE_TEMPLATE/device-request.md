  Screenshots help to identify the device and its capabilities. Please refer to:

  for examples of the required screenshots.

  Required screenshots:
  - Endpoints and clusters of the node
  - Node Info panel
  - Basic Cluster attributes in the Cluster Info panel.

  In the Cluster Info panel press "read" button to retreive the values. Please note that at least "Manufacturer Name" and "Model Identifier" must be populated with data (therefore, must not be empty), otherwise that information will not be usable. For battery powered devices, after pressing read it is required to wake-up the device by pressing a button or any other means of interaction.
