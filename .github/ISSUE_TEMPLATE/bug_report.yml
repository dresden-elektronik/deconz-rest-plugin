        Debug logs can help to investigate certain problems like device pairing and communication issues. Logging can be enabled on the command line as described in: https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/deCONZ-debug-flags
        Secondly, for versions above 2.05.87: In the deCONZ GUI: click Help > debug view. Output of ERROR, ERROR_L2, INFO and INFO_L2 can be handy. APS and APS_L2 can be very helpful, but is also very verbose.
