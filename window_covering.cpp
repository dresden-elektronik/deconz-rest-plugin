 *
 * Step 1
 *    In order to calibrate the device, first choose the appropriate device type.
 *    0 = Roller Shade Lift only, ..., 6 = Shutter Tilt only, ..., 8 Tilt Blind Lift & Tilt
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x0000 (“WindowCoveringType”) accordingly.
 * Step 2
 *    Prepare calibration by setting these values:
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x0010 (“InstalledOpenLimitLift”) as 0x0000 = 0cm.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x0011 (“InstalledClosedLimitLift”) as 0x00F0 = 240cm.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x0012 (“InstalledOpenLimitTilt”) as 0x0000 = 0°.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x0013 (“InstalledClosedLimitTilt”) as 0x0384 = 90.0°.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x1001 (“LiftToTiltTransitionSteps”) as 0xFFFF = invalid.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x1002 (“TotalSteps”) as 0xFFFF = invalid.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x1003 (“LiftToTiltTransitionSteps2”) as 0xFFFF = invalid.
 *    Write attribute 0x10F2:0x1004 (“TotalSteps2”) as 0xFFFF = invalid
 * Step 3
 *    Enter calibration mode:
 *    Write attribute 0x0017 (“Mode”) as 0x02.
 * Step 4
 *    Send the "move down" command and "stop" after a few centimeters.
 * Step 5
 *    Send the “move up” command. When the device reaches its top position,
 *    J1 will recognize the upper bound.
 * Step 6
 *    After J1 has reached the top position and the motor has stopped, send the “move down” command.
 * Step 7
 *    After J1 has reached the lower bound and the motor has stopped, send the “move up” command.
 *    J1 will search for the upper bound. Once the top position is reached,
 *    calibration of the total steps in both directions is complete.
 * Step 8
 *    In case of a tilt blind set attribute 0x10F2:0x1001 and 0x10F2:0x1003 to the time it takes for a lift-to tilt
 *    transition (down) or a tilt-to-lift transition (up), respectively. Otherwise proceed with the next step.
 * Step 9
 *    To leave calibration mode, clear bit #1 in the Mode attribute, e.g. write attribute 0x0017 as 0x00.
